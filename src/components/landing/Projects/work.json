        "description": "Devised a solution to cluster similar trending Twitter hashtags. Used weighted ensembling of two pretrained Doc2Vec models to create a feature-rich vector representation of each hashtag's context, which was fetched using Twitter's API. Finally, cosine similarity was calculated between each vector representation to measure the similarity between each trend in order to cluster them. Used Django based REST API to connect the backend with frontend.",
